stdin >> page request and put it in page table
if page in table do not add again

code in c, c++, rust

number of request - number of misses = number of hits
hit rate = hits/requests (always < 1)

cat accesses txt |./(our program) (insert size of pages)

make sure to use headers! (include headers in other files)

Objective: Graph of hit rate and page table size, why which algorithm is better
